World Cup 2014 Sweepstakes Picker
=================================

Due to limited development time (an hour or so), there are some limitations:

1) As we had 9 people, the Netherlands had to be added to the top seeds so that each person had a Top 9 team. This could be coded to be more dynamic.

2) The number of punters is assumed, and the list is hard-coded. Again, this could be more dynamic.

3) It runs in Python 3+ on Windows only.

4) More export options could be added, and the user could be prompted to choose which filetype they want.
